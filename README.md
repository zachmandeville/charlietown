# charlietown
A site to see pictures of that good cat Charlie

# Summary
This is a small site for Angelica so she can see pictures of that good cat charlie, and put in pictures of her own.  This readme is slim and aspirational now, cos it being built up in realtime.  If you are seeing a mostly messy readme that don't make much sense, give it a couple days and come back!  Yr essentially reading a public diary right now.

# Spinning it Up
One day you'll be able to visit the site on the web.  When that day comes, we'll let you know here.

# Philosophy

It is useful to know how to build more small tools that serve a single, personal purpose.  In my case, it's having a site that displays pictures of Charlie and this site is collaborative between myself and Angelica.  We should both be able to edit and update through an easy interface.

The other main philosophy of this is learning the thing I've put myself in a position to learn.  In this case, it's react and redux and api calls to a database.   There are other ways this app could be built, and likely much easier (and maybe not even using javascript).  But I am using react and redux as a means of learning the concepts behind them better.


# API
This will detail the api that is being built and used to query that charlieDb.
